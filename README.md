## Building the Project

### Dependencies

The Ionic Game Engine has lots of dependencies. This is an incomplete list of
the most import ones.

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)

### Building the Engine

#### Linux

The `build.sh` does everything you need to build the project from the command line.

This includes:

- Building the core engine and linking glfw.
- Optionally running the associated static tests on your local machine.

Simply run:

```Output
$ ./build.sh
Do you wish to also run the build tests? [y/n]: y
