# Contributing

The Ionic project was created by and for the students of Tigard High who are members of the Game Development Club and as such we are not accepting pull 
requests from individuals outside of Tigard High students. If you have any suggestions please raise an issue, however we are not allowed to accept outside
help for implementation. For this reason we ask that you keep your suggestions as general as possible without including any specific code snippits.

## Game Club Members

If you are a member of the Tigard High School Game Development Club congratulations! You are in the right place! We hope you share the same love for 
programming and gaming that has driven us to be where we are today! Here are some basic steps to follow for contributing.

### Steps for Contributing

1. Raise an issue.

We ask that every item that is worked on has an issue from the beginning to the end of it's lifetime.

2. Update the Project Board

We have a [Project Board](https://github.com/TigardHighGDC/Ionic/projects/3) that track all issues currently being worked on, if you are working on something please make sure that it is reflected in
the project board.

3. Open a Pull Request

Once you have a solution to the feature or bug you are working on open a pull request. Please keep in mind that we maintain high standards for our code
and it may take a few revisions until everyone is happy with the suggested code. When opening your pr please make sure that you link the issue it is 
supposed to fix. More about that can be found in the [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/TigardHighGDC/Ionic/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).

4. Close you Issue

Mark your issue with the `fixed` tag and close the issue. If you linked the issue properly it should close itself.

### Other Tips

Take a look at previous pull requests to see what our process looks like to get a better idea of how we write and review code.

We can't wait to recieve your PR! If you have any questions please connect with any of our maintainers or join the discord!
