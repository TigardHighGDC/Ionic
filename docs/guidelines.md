# Ionic Guidelines
#
#### Readible
- Code should be intuitive to understand
- Code should be simple to write
- Variables should be easy to distinguish between
#### Standardized
- Different classes shouldn't perform the same task
- Variables should be able to be used universally. For example angle stored as radians shouldn't be translated to degrees to be used in certain classes
- Classes shouldn't interfere with each other
