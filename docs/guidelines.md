# Ionic Guidelines

#### Readable

- Code should be intuitive to understand
- Code should be simple to write. For example capitalization at the beginning of variables is unnecessary
- Variables should be easy to distinguish between

#### Standardized

- Prioritize avoiding redundancy over adding features. For example different classes shouldn't perform the same task
- Variables should be able to be used universally. For example angle stored as radians shouldn't be translated to degrees to be used in certain classes
- Classes shouldn't interfere with each other
